# Olympics RR
A html game inspired by "Video Olympics" for the Atary 2600. The game is built on [Crafty](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty) (craftyjs).

The goal for this game is to be controled by homemade 'paddles', made of potentiometers and run on a RaspberryPi. But at the moment the game is controlled using WASD and arrow keys. Press 'U' to change scene and 'P' for pause.
